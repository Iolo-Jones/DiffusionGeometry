# DiffusionGeometry
This is the code for **Diffusion Geometry (2024)** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10858

* The notebook **Introduction_to_DG** shows how to import and use some of the basic functions in diffusion geometry.

Core source code:
* **DiffusionGeometry** contains all the main functions
* **DG_classes** defines a class structure for computing DG, and is what you should usually import in practice

Demos and plots from the paper:
* 2-forms
* ABM
* complexity_testing
* manifold_testing
* tumour_immune_cells

Utilities:
* data_loader
* DG_ml_stats
* visualisation
